![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyArno/MyWeek/dev/res/images/Screenshot.png)
### Ð¡apabilities
My week is simple weeks organizer build by Typescript and Electrone.

  - Task planning for each hour in week
  - Few weeks
  - Support actions as open files/links
  - Support notifications by HTML5



### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript!
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) -  open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation and Run

MyWeek requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexeyArno/MyWeek
$ cd MyWeek
$ npm install 
$ electron .
```
### Build

Build work by [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager)

```sh
$ electron-packager path\to\MyWeek MyWeek --icon="path\to\MyWeek\res\images\logo.ico"
```

### Development
